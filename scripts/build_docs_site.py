"""Assemble the published documentation site from the repo's own markdown.

The site at https://nitinksingh.com/e-commerce-agents/ is a *rendering* of this
repository, never a second copy of it. That distinction is the whole design:

- **Nothing is committed for the site's benefit.** The obvious route — put
  Jekyll front matter in all 100-odd markdown files — degrades the repo's own
  reading experience, because GitHub renders front matter as a metadata table at
  the top of every file. Every page here also already carries its title as an
  H1, which just-the-docs would then render a second time. So front matter is
  injected here, at build time, into a gitignored ``_site_src/``.

- **Links point in three directions and must all keep working.** Tutorials link
  to sibling chapters, up to ``docs/``, and out to real source files under
  ``agents/``. Docs link back to the root README. Publishing ``docs/`` alone
  breaks one of those directions; publishing all three trees into one site means
  every relative link has to be rewritten to either a site path or a GitHub blob
  URL. That rewriting is the bulk of this script, and ``--check`` is what stops
  it rotting.

Reverse of ``scripts/migrate_tutorials_to_hugo.py``, which moved content *out*
of the repo and left stubs behind — the decision Phase 4 spent weeks undoing.
This one only ever reads.

Usage::

    uv run python scripts/build_docs_site.py           # build _site_src/
    uv run python scripts/build_docs_site.py --check    # verify, exit non-zero
