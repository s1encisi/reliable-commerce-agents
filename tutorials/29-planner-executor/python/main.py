"""
MAF v1 — Chapter 29: Planner-Executor (Python)

Decompose a user request into an ordered plan up front (structured Pydantic
output from a "planner" agent), then execute each step in sequence with an
"executor" agent — a step might be a product-catalog search or a reasoning
step over earlier results. The plan is printed before any step runs, then
each step's result is printed as it executes.

Contrast with the router/tool pattern (Chapters 02, 12+ / this repo's own
"tool" orchestration mode): there, the LLM decides one tool call at a time,
reactively, with no advance plan. Here, the whole plan is committed to and
inspectable up front — more predictable, easier to approve or cost-estimate,
but less adaptive to a step's surprise result unless you add re-planning
(not implemented here — see "Gotchas").
