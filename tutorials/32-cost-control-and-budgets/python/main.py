MAF v1 — Chapter 32: Cost Control and Budgets (Python)

A single `ChatMiddleware` that tracks the cumulative estimated USD cost of
every LLM turn in a run and, once a configured ceiling is crossed, refuses
to start the *next* turn — a toy stand-in for
`agents/python/shared/guardrails/cost_budget_middleware.py`'s
`CostBudgetMiddleware`. Same two-tier posture (`observe` never blocks,
`enforce` does), same short-circuit mechanic (set `context.result` to a
refusal and skip `call_next()`), simplified to a plain instance attribute
instead of a `ContextVar` — this script's turns run sequentially in one
process, not across concurrent asyncio tasks that each need an isolated
running total.

`get_product_price` is a canned-data tool (no real catalog lookup). Each
question triggers a two-turn tool-calling loop (one turn where the model
calls the tool, one where it reads the result and answers) — accumulating
cost turn by turn is the whole point, so a single-turn demo wouldn't show
anything interesting. `DEMO_BUDGET_USD_PER_RUN` is deliberately tiny
(a fraction of a cent) purely so the ceiling trips within two or three
short demo questions instead of requiring a very long, expensive run —
production ceilings (`COST_BUDGET_USD_PER_RUN`) are set per real workload,
not to this toy's scale.

Note on replay mode: `tutorials/_shared/replay_client.py`'s `ReplayChatClient`
deliberately composes `FunctionInvocationLayer` directly with
`BaseChatClient`, skipping `ChatMiddlewareLayer` (see that module's own
docstring) — a replay client doesn't need it just to play back a
tool-calling fixture correctly. That means `CostBudgetChatMiddleware.process()`
never runs under `LLM_PROVIDER=replay`: the replay test below only proves
the tool-calling round trip replays correctly, not that the budget
middleware fired. The `[budget]` prints and the refusal only show up
against a live LLM (`LLM_PROVIDER=azure` or `openai`) — same limitation
Chapter 06's PII-redaction `ChatMiddleware` has, which is why that
chapter's chat-middleware assertion is a live-LLM-only test too.

    - `observe` — accumulate and print the running cost; never blocks, even
