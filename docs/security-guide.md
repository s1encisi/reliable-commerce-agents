## Threat Model

### Attack surface

```
AUTH_MODE=local (default):
Browser  ──JWT (HS256)──►  Orchestrator (:8080)  ──X-Agent-Secret──►  Specialists (:8081–8085)  ──►  MCP servers (:9000–9001, unauthenticated)
                                  │                                           │
                            PostgreSQL / pgvector                        Redis (cache)

AUTH_MODE=oauth (optional — self-hosted AS, no external IdP):
Browser  ──JWT (RS256)──►  Orchestrator  ──Bearer <agent:invoke>──►  Specialists  ──Bearer <mcp:product|mcp:inventory>──►  MCP servers
                                  │                                           │                                                │
                                  └──────────────────── all three validate against the AS's JWKS (:8090) ─────────────────────┘
```

The platform has three principal trust boundaries:

1. **Browser → Orchestrator** — unauthenticated HTTP. Attacker is any internet client. `local` mode: self-issued HS256 JWT. `oauth` mode: the orchestrator brokers a Resource Owner Password Credentials grant against the self-hosted Authorization Server (AS) and relays its RS256 access/refresh tokens — the AS is the sole authority on credentials.
2. **Orchestrator → Specialists** — internal network. `local` mode: static shared secret. `oauth` mode: a short-lived AS-issued client-credentials service token (`aud=ecommerce-agents`, `scope=agent:invoke`) per call — the shared secret is rejected outright, not just unused. Attacker is a compromised container that knows the secret/can mint or steal a token, but may still supply arbitrary forwarded identity headers.
3. **Specialists → MCP servers** — internal network, only reachable when `MCP_ENABLED=true`. `local`/default: unauthenticated. `oauth` mode with `MCP_AUTH_ENABLED=true`: each MCP server is an OAuth 2.1 resource server — a separate client-credentials token per resource (`scope=mcp:product` / `mcp:inventory`), independently acquired and cached, rejected if presented at the wrong server.

### Threat categories

| Category | Vector | Defenses applied |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Direct prompt injection** | Attacker crafts a user message containing `ignore previous instructions` or a fake turn prefix | `InjectionDetectionChatMiddleware` (observe) + `grounding-rules.yaml` (prompt layer) |
| **Stored / indirect injection** | Adversarial text embedded in product descriptions, review bodies, or order notes that re-enters the model as a tool result | `OutputSanitizationMiddleware` neutralizes before re-injection |
| **Role escalation** | Attacker claims to be admin/seller in the message body | `grounding-rules.yaml` role-confinement rules + `@requires_role` decorator on privileged tools + SQL ownership filters |
| **Identity spoofing (inter-agent)** | Compromised caller forwards arbitrary `x-user-email` / `x-user-role` headers alongside a valid secret or service token | `_identity_anomaly()` validation + `GUARDRAILS_STRICT_IDENTITY` flag (checked in both `local` and `oauth` modes) |
| **JWT forgery / replay** | Attacker supplies an expired, tampered, or wrong-audience Bearer token | `local`: `decode_token()` HS256 + `jwt.ExpiredSignatureError`/`jwt.InvalidTokenError`. `oauth`: RS256 signature + issuer + audience + expiry validated against the AS's JWKS (`RS256Verifier`); a token minted for one audience/scope (e.g. `api:chat`) is rejected everywhere else (e.g. `agent:invoke`, `mcp:product`) |
| **Cross-resource token reuse (MCP)** | A token scoped for one MCP server (e.g. `mcp:product`) is replayed against another (`mcp:inventory`) or against the inter-agent path | Each resource server validates its own `aud` + `required_scope`; mismatches are rejected `401` regardless of an otherwise-valid signature |
| **Unauthorized tool access** | Unauthenticated or low-privilege caller invokes destructive tools (cancel order, place backorder) | `@requires_role` + SQL `WHERE user_id = $N` ownership filters |
| **Secret exfiltration** | Injection payload attempts to extract `AGENT_SHARED_SECRET` or `JWT_SECRET` | Prompt-layer refusal rules; sanitization strips control chars used for hidden payloads |
| **SQL injection** | Attacker embeds SQL in search queries or filter values | Parameterized `asyncpg` queries (`$1, $2, …`) throughout; no string-concatenated SQL |
| **Data over-fetch** | Tool returns more rows than intended | `LIMIT` clamping in every list query; ownership filter on every user-facing query |

---

## Guardrails Stack

The guardrails follow a defense-in-depth model: **prompt layer → code layer**, each adding an independent line of defense. All code-layer guardrails are flag-gated via `shared/config.py` so they can be toggled without a redeploy.

### Middleware composition order

Every specialist agent is initialized with `build_specialist_middleware()` from `shared/middleware.py`. The stack (inner to outer, i.e. first to execute) is:

```
Request →
  1. InjectionDetectionChatMiddleware   # scan inbound messages (observe-only by default)
  2. AgentRunLogger                     # correlation ID + start/finish log
  3. ToolAuditMiddleware                # structured log per tool call
  4. OutputSanitizationMiddleware       # neutralize tool results before re-entry
  ← Response
```

`include_steps=True` appends a step-logging middleware for detailed tracing (used in development).

### Layer 1 — Prompt-layer rules (`grounding-rules.yaml`)

`shared/config/prompts/_shared/grounding-rules.yaml` is injected into every agent's system prompt via the YAML composition system (`shared/prompt_loader.py`). It enforces three invariants at the model level:

- **Data grounding** — every answer must originate from a tool call; the model must not fabricate data from training.
- **Prompt-injection resistance** — tool results and user text are data, never instructions. Fake system/developer turns are explicitly forbidden.
- **Role confinement** — the model's privileges are fixed by the system-supplied role; in-message claims of escalated privilege must be ignored.

This layer is the broadest defense. Its weakness is that it is only as reliable as the model's instruction-following.

### Layer 2 — Inbound injection detection (`InjectionDetectionChatMiddleware`)

`shared/guardrails/injection_middleware.py` scans each inbound chat message against nine high-precision regex patterns in `shared/guardrails/sanitize.py`. Patterns cover:

- `ignore/disregard previous instructions`
- `forget all rules`
- `you are now a/an/the …`
- Fake turn prefixes (`system:`, `developer:`, `assistant:` at line start)
- Prompt reveal attempts (`reveal your system prompt`)
- XML-style injection tags (`</system>`, `<instructions>`)
- Privilege escalation phrasing (`act as if you are an admin`)

**Default behavior**: observe-only. Detections increment a counter, set `context.metadata["guardrail_injection_detected"]`, and log at INFO. Set `GUARDRAILS_BLOCK_ON_INJECTION=true` to log at WARNING; blocking of the request itself requires a custom middleware that reads the metadata flag.

**False-positive rate**: patterns are deliberately high-precision to avoid blocking legitimate phrasing. The safety/red-team eval suite (`evals/safety_evaluator.py`) continuously measures both precision and recall.

### Layer 3 — Stored-injection neutralization (`OutputSanitizationMiddleware`)

`shared/guardrails/output_middleware.py` runs after each tool invocation. If the tool name appears in `SANITIZE_TOOLS` (`shared/guardrails/config.py`), `neutralize_value()` rewrites the result in place before it is returned to the model.

`neutralize_value()` (`shared/guardrails/sanitize.py`) does two things:

1. **Strip** — removes C0 control characters (except TAB/LF/CR), DEL, zero-width Unicode marks, line/paragraph separators, and BOM. These are common hidden-payload carriers.
2. **Defang** — replaces pattern matches with `[neutralized]`, preserving the structure and length so downstream analysis (fake-review detection, sentiment) can still see that something was there.

Only the tools whose results carry user-generated free text are in `SANITIZE_TOOLS`. Each entry optionally specifies a field allowlist so structured fields (prices, SKUs) are never mangled.

**Fail behavior**: controlled by `GUARDRAILS_FAIL_OPEN` (default `true`). On an unexpected exception, the raw result is returned and the error is logged. Set `GUARDRAILS_FAIL_OPEN=false` for fail-closed behavior in high-security deployments.

### Layer 4 — Tool-level role authorization (`@requires_role`)

`shared/guardrails/roles.py` provides two forms:

```python
# Decorator — place directly under @tool so MAF introspects the original signature
@tool(name="get_my_products", description="…")
@requires_role("seller", "admin")
async def get_my_products(…): …

# Guard clause — for retrofitting existing tools without re-ordering decorators
denied = ensure_role("seller", "admin", tool="get_my_products")
if denied:
    return denied
```

`admin` is always allowed (superuser) regardless of the `roles` argument. Identity is read from the `current_user_role` ContextVar, which is set by `AgentAuthMiddleware` and never passed as a function argument.

All four tools in `shared/tools/seller_tools.py` (`get_seller_products`, `update_product_price`, `get_seller_analytics`, `get_payout_summary`) carry `@requires_role("seller", "admin")`. See the [audit matrix](agent-audit-matrix.md) for the remaining open items.

### Configuration flags

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `GUARDRAILS_ENABLED` | `true` | Master switch. `false` disables all code-layer guardrails. |
| `GUARDRAILS_OUTPUT_SANITIZATION` | `true` | Enable/disable `OutputSanitizationMiddleware`. |
| `GUARDRAILS_BLOCK_ON_INJECTION` | `false` | Log injection detections at WARNING instead of INFO. |
| `GUARDRAILS_FAIL_OPEN` | `true` | Sanitization errors return the raw result rather than raising. |
| `GUARDRAILS_STRICT_IDENTITY` | `false` | Reject inter-agent calls with malformed forwarded identity. |
| `GUARDRAILS_INJECTION_PROVIDER` | `regex` | Reserved for future Azure AI Content Safety integration. |

---

## Authentication and Identity Flow

### External requests (Browser → Orchestrator)

**`AUTH_MODE=local` (default):**

```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
```

`AgentAuthMiddleware` (`shared/auth.py`) validates the token using `decode_token()` (`shared/jwt_utils.py`):

1. HS256 decode with `JWT_SECRET`
2. Checks `type == "access"` claim (refresh tokens are rejected)
3. Extracts `sub` (email), `role`, and `user_id` from the payload
4. Sets three ContextVars: `current_user_email`, `current_user_role`, `current_session_id`

Paths `/health` and `/.well-known/agent-card.json` bypass auth.

JWT signing uses `bcrypt` for passwords and `PyJWT` for token generation. Default `JWT_SECRET` is `change-me-in-production` — the config validator warns if this is not overridden at startup.

**`AUTH_MODE=oauth`:** the orchestrator's `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/refresh` routes broker the request to the self-hosted Authorization Server (AS, `agents/python/auth_server/`) instead of issuing tokens locally:

- **Login** relays a `password` (ROPC) grant to the AS as a confidential first-party client — the AS re-verifies the bcrypt hash from the same `users` table, so this does not duplicate the password check. The AS returns an RS256 access token (`aud=ecommerce-orchestrator`, `scope=api:chat`, `role`/`user_id` custom claims) plus an opaque refresh token.
- **Refresh** relays a `refresh_token` grant. The AS does not rotate refresh tokens (`INCLUDE_NEW_REFRESH_TOKEN=False`) — a deliberate choice, since the frontend never re-persists a rotated refresh token.
- `AgentAuthMiddleware`'s Bearer branch validates the RS256 token against the AS's published JWKS (`RS256Verifier` / `.NET`'s `JwtTokenService.ValidateOAuth` + `JwksKeyProvider`): signature, issuer, audience, expiry, and required scope.
- Phases A–D of the OAuth work all shipped and are live-verified on both stacks. What remains — key rotation, RFC 7591 dynamic client registration, and the audit matrix — is tracked in [`.claude/plans/remaining-work.md`](https://github.com/nitin27may/e-commerce-agents/blob/26f47c494dd6b371312593e82f066713f6f56e9c/.claude/plans/remaining-work.md).

### Inter-agent requests (Orchestrator → Specialists)

**`AUTH_MODE=local` (default):**

```
X-Agent-Secret: <AGENT_SHARED_SECRET>
X-User-Email:   alice@example.com
X-User-Role:    customer
X-Session-ID:   <session>
```

The shared secret authenticates the caller (proves it is a platform agent, not an external client). The forwarded `X-User-Email` and `X-User-Role` headers carry the end-user's identity through the agent chain.

**`AUTH_MODE=oauth`:** the shared secret is not merely unused but actively **rejected** — a request bearing `X-Agent-Secret` gets a 401 instead of silently falling through. Instead:

```
Authorization: Bearer <AS-issued service token, aud=ecommerce-agents, scope=agent:invoke>
X-User-Email:  alice@example.com
X-User-Role:   customer
X-Session-ID:  <session>
```

The caller acquires this service token via a `client_credentials` grant (`shared/oauth/service_client.py::acquire_service_token`, cached per `(scope, audience)` with a 30s refresh skew — `.NET`'s `AuthServerClient.AcquireServiceTokenAsync`). The token proves the caller is a legitimate first-party agent; the end-user's actual identity still travels via the same forwarded `X-User-*` headers as `local` mode. System/health-originated calls carry a service token with no forwarded headers at all, mapping to `role=system`.

Either mode, `_identity_anomaly()` validates the forwarded headers the same way:

- `role` must be one of `customer`, `seller`, `admin`, `system`
- `email` must contain `@` (unless it is the sentinel value `system`)

If `GUARDRAILS_STRICT_IDENTITY=true`, anomalies result in a 401 instead of a logged warning.

### MCP resource-server auth (Specialists → MCP servers, optional)

Only relevant when `MCP_ENABLED=true` (specialists fetch product/inventory data via MCP instead of direct DB access). With `MCP_AUTH_ENABLED=true`, each MCP server becomes an OAuth 2.1 resource server per [RFC 9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728):

- **Python** (`packages/mcp-product`, `packages/mcp-inventory`): a vendored `JwksTokenVerifier` (`mcp.server.auth.provider.TokenVerifier`) validates the bearer JWT via `PyJWKClient` — audience `mcp-product`/`mcp-inventory`, required scope `mcp:product`/`mcp:inventory`. Wired into `FastMCP(token_verifier=..., auth=AuthSettings(...))`; the SDK auto-mounts `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` and wraps `POST /mcp` in `RequireAuthMiddleware`, returning `401` + a spec-shaped `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token", ..., resource_metadata="..."` header on failure.
- **.NET** (`ECommerceAgents.Mcp`): `McpEndpoints.cs` hand-rolls the equivalent as ASP.NET Core middleware ahead of the real MCP server's own routing — `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` and a `WWW-Authenticate` 401 on any request under `/mcp`, reusing the same `JwtTokenService.ValidateOAuth` + `JwksKeyProvider` used for Phase B/C. No `AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi`.
- The MCP-calling specialist acquires its own resource token the same way as the inter-agent case, cached separately per `(scope, audience)` — a `mcp:product` token cannot authenticate to the `mcp-inventory` server or vice versa, nor can an `agent:invoke` inter-agent token be reused against either MCP server.
- `MCPStreamableHTTPTool`'s `header_provider` callback (MAF's documented mechanism for attaching per-request auth headers) is invoked **synchronously** from inside an already-running event loop, so it cannot itself perform the token acquisition. Each specialist's async startup hook pre-warms the token cache once (`await acquire_service_token(...)`); the header provider then does a synchronous cache-only read.
- Flag off (`MCP_AUTH_ENABLED=false`, the default) → both MCP servers behave exactly as before this feature — no auth surface at all.

### Identity propagation via ContextVars

`shared/context.py` exposes three `contextvars.ContextVar` objects: `current_user_email`, `current_user_role`, `current_session_id`. Auth middleware sets these at the request boundary; every tool reads from them directly. Identity is never threaded through function arguments.

This means the identity chain is:

```
HTTP request → AgentAuthMiddleware.dispatch()
             → ContextVar.set(email, role, session_id)
             → tool function
             → current_user_role.get()
             → @requires_role check / SQL WHERE clause
```

---

## Data Access Controls

### SQL ownership filters

Every user-facing query uses a parameterized `WHERE user_id = $N` or `WHERE u.email = $N` clause. No query returns rows belonging to other users. This is enforced at the query level — not in the tool's Python logic — so it cannot be bypassed by prompt injection.

Example (all queries follow this pattern):

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = $1)
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20
```

### LIMIT clamping

All list queries include an explicit `LIMIT`. Tools that accept a user-supplied `limit` argument clamp it to a maximum:

```python
async def get_user_orders(limit: Annotated[int, "Max results"] = 10) -> list[dict]:
    effective_limit = min(limit, 50)  # caller cannot exceed 50
    …
```

### Parameterized queries

All database access uses `asyncpg`'s parameterized query syntax (`$1, $2, …`). No string concatenation is used to build SQL. This eliminates SQL injection at the query-construction layer.

## Azure AI Content Safety — Optional Integration

The `GUARDRAILS_INJECTION_PROVIDER` config flag reserves the integration point for [Azure AI Content Safety Prompt Shields](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-safety/concepts/jailbreak-detection). When set to `azure_content_safety`, the injection detection pipeline would call the Prompt Shields API before the regex layer, providing a cloud-backed ML classifier with higher recall and continuous Microsoft model updates.

**Current state**: the flag is wired but the Azure backend is not yet implemented — `shared/guardrails/azure_shield.py` does not exist. Setting `GUARDRAILS_INJECTION_PROVIDER=azure_content_safety` is rejected at startup with a "not implemented" error (`shared/config.py::_validate_injection_provider`) rather than silently falling back to the regex provider. The regex-based provider (`GUARDRAILS_INJECTION_PROVIDER=regex`) remains the only active, supported path.

**When to enable this**: in production deployments handling untrusted end users at scale, especially if the eval suite shows the regex layer missing novel phrasing. The API adds latency (~100–200 ms per request); gate it behind `GUARDRAILS_BLOCK_ON_INJECTION` to avoid blocking on false positives during rollout. This remains aspirational until `azure_shield.py` ships.

**Implementation sketch** (not yet merged):

```python
# shared/guardrails/injection_middleware.py — proposed extension
if settings.GUARDRAILS_INJECTION_PROVIDER == "azure_content_safety":
    from shared.guardrails.azure_shield import check_prompt_shields
    flagged = await check_prompt_shields(messages)
else:
    flagged = any(contains_injection_markers(m.text) for m in messages)
```

## Production Hardening Checklist

| Item | Config / Action |
|------|----------------|
| Rotate `JWT_SECRET` | Set to a 256-bit random value; store in Azure Key Vault |
| Rotate `AGENT_SHARED_SECRET` | Same rotation cadence; inject via Managed Identity or Key Vault reference |
| Enable strict identity | `GUARDRAILS_STRICT_IDENTITY=true` |
| Enable fail-closed sanitization | `GUARDRAILS_FAIL_OPEN=false` |
| Evaluate blocking on injection | `GUARDRAILS_BLOCK_ON_INJECTION=true` after measuring false-positive rate in staging |
| Enable HTTPS everywhere | TLS termination at the AKS ingress; no plain HTTP between pods |
| Network policy | Restrict specialist ports (8081–8085) to orchestrator pod only |
| Complete role enforcement | Add `@requires_role` on open items in the [audit matrix](agent-audit-matrix.md) |
| Enable the self-hosted OAuth server | `AUTH_MODE=oauth` — user login via ROPC brokered by the orchestrator, client-credentials service tokens for A2A and MCP, RS256 signing via a JWKS (single active key per `kid`, no automatic rotation yet — see Known Issues); retires `JWT_SECRET` and `AGENT_SHARED_SECRET` (rejected outright, not just unused). Set `AUTH_SIGNING_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and per-service `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` from your secret store; never ship the `OAUTH_SEED_KEY` dev default. Remaining OAuth work is tracked in [`.claude/plans/remaining-work.md`](https://github.com/nitin27may/e-commerce-agents/blob/26f47c494dd6b371312593e82f066713f6f56e9c/.claude/plans/remaining-work.md) |
| Protect MCP servers | `MCP_AUTH_ENABLED=true` (requires `MCP_ENABLED=true`) — both Python MCP servers and the .NET MCP host validate the auth-server's RS256 bearer tokens (audience + scope, one resource-specific scope per server) against its JWKS, expose `.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`, and reject unauthenticated or wrong-scope calls with `401` + `WWW-Authenticate` |

---

## Known Issues (self-hosted OAuth server, optional feature)

- **No signing-key rotation.** `auth_server/keys.py::ensure_active_key` bootstraps one RSA keypair idempotently and reuses it for the process lifetime — there is no scheduled rotation or multi-key overlap window. A `kid` header is stamped on every token so a future rotation mechanism can add keys to the JWKS without immediately invalidating outstanding tokens, but nothing generates a second key today.
- **.NET specialists and the .NET MCP host are now containerized.** Each of the 5 specialists and `ECommerceAgents.Mcp` has its own `Dockerfile` (mirroring the orchestrator's), and `docker-compose.dotnet.yml` composes all of them (`mcp-inventory` under the `mcp` profile). Live-verified: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dotnet.yml --profile agents --profile mcp --profile seed up --build` brings up all 8 services healthy, and a real chat turn (real Azure OpenAI, real login) correctly routes through `AGENT_REGISTRY` to a real specialist and back. One asymmetry remains: there is still no .NET equivalent of Python's `mcp-product` server — only `mcp-inventory` has a .NET port, matching the single `ECommerceAgents.Mcp` project that exists today.
- **Dynamic client registration (RFC 7591) is opt-in and scope-limited.** `POST /oauth/register` exists (`auth_server/register.py` + `auth_server/main.py`), gated behind `AUTH_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_REGISTRATION` (default `false`). Even when enabled, registering requires a bearer token scoped `client:register` (obtained via `client_credentials` by the seeded `auth-admin` client — a credential kept separate from `orchestrator`'s broader trust). Registered clients are capped to `client_credentials` only and to the two MCP read scopes (`mcp:product`, `mcp:inventory`) — the endpoint cannot mint a client that could ever request `agent:invoke`, `api:chat`, or `client:register` itself. First-party services still come from `scripts/seed.py`'s static list; this only covers third-party MCP consumers.
  - **A real bug found only by live-testing this against the actual running server, not by unit tests alone**: the first implementation verified the registration bearer token by reusing `shared/oauth/verifier.py::RS256Verifier` — the same JWKS-over-HTTP verifier every *other* resource server uses. That deadlocked in practice: the AS is a single-worker asyncio process, and its own request handler synchronously fetching its own JWKS over HTTP blocks the same event loop that would need to service that very inbound connection, timing out every time. No other resource server hits this because none of them is handling a request *from itself* while fetching JWKS. Fixed by verifying entirely in-process instead — the AS already holds its own signing key in memory (`auth_server/main.py::_verify_registration_token`), so there's no network round trip at all, just local signature verification plus manual `iss`/`aud`/`scope`/`exp` claim checks (`joserfc`'s `decode` only verifies the signature, unlike PyJWT's `jwt.decode`).
