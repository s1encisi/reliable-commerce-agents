# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

E-Commerce Agents is a multi-agent e-commerce platform built with **Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)** Python SDK. 6 specialized agents collaborate via **A2A protocol** to handle product discovery, orders, pricing, reviews, inventory, and customer support. Includes a marketplace layer with agent catalog, access requests, and admin approval.

Companion demo repo for the AI article series on nitinksingh.com.

## Working Artifacts Location

All working artifacts — **memory, rules, and plans** — live in the **repo-local `.claude/` folder
only**:

- `.claude/memory/` — project memory and notes
- `.claude/rules/` — repo-specific rules
- `.claude/plans/` — **one** consolidated plan (`remaining-work.md`). Finished plans are deleted
  rather than archived: git keeps them, and a directory of stale plans makes "what is left?" a
  research question every time it is asked

Do not put these in the repo root (no top-level `plans/` folder) or rely on global `~/.claude`.
The repo-local .claude/ directory is **local-only** and excluded from Git uploads because it may
contain personal plans, environment details, and private tool state. Do not force-add it. Keep reviewed,
sanitized project documentation under docs/; the shareable technical plan is
docs/zh-CN/after-sales-reliability-plan.md. See docs/local-privacy.md for the upload boundary.

## Architecture Overview

**Request flow**: Browser -> Next.js frontend (:3000) -> Orchestrator FastAPI (:8080) -> Specialist agents via A2A (:8081-8085) -> PostgreSQL/Redis

The **orchestrator** is the front door. All user requests go through it. Its LLM calls `call_specialist_agent()` tool to route to the appropriate specialist via HTTP POST to `/message:send`.

Each specialist agent runs as an independent microservice with its own port and A2A endpoint, but all share a single Dockerfile (multi-target via `ARG AGENT_NAME`).

### Orchestrator route layout

`orchestrator/routes/` is a package, not a single file: `chat.py` holds `/api/chat` + `/api/chat/stream`, `orchestration.py` holds the mode-introspection endpoints (`/api/orchestration/modes`, `.../graph`, `.../compare` — real as of Phase 1.6c, runs one prompt through several modes sequentially and reports per-mode text/latency/steps/graph; `tokens`/`est_cost_usd`/`grounding` aren't in the response yet, since they need Phase 3.5/Phase 2 infrastructure that doesn't exist — and `.../{run_id}/resume`, real as of Phase 1.5), and `legacy.py` holds everything else (auth, marketplace, admin, cart, checkout, orders, seller, and — Phase 1.5 — `GET /api/runs/{id}/checkpoints`) — the pre-split monolith, kept together since the split's purpose was isolating chat, not fully decomposing the route surface. `orchestrator/routes/__init__.py` combines all three into the single `router` `orchestrator/main.py` includes, and re-exports `optional_auth`/`require_auth`/`require_admin`/`require_seller`/`settings` so existing import sites are unaffected.

**Web UI (Phase 1.6).** `web/src/components/chat/mode-switcher.tsx` (1.6a) is a composer control fed by `GET /api/orchestration/modes`, threading the selected mode through `api.ts::chatStream()`'s `mode` option and persisting it per conversation in localStorage. `orchestration-graph.tsx` (1.6b) renders a mode's `graph_mermaid()` output client-side (house palette applied client-side — the backend's generated source carries no styling) and animates nodes live from the `onOrchestrationEvent` hook's `node`/`error` frames; correlating a live `node_id` to a diagram node relies on a deliberate backend convention — every workflow mode's `graph_mermaid()` uses the real executor id with dashes swapped for underscores as the Mermaid node id (see `PrePurchaseMode.graph_mermaid()`'s comment in `workflow_mode.py`). `mode-comparison.tsx` (1.6c) is a standalone dialog (not tied to the active conversation) that calls `POST /api/orchestration/compare` and renders a result card per mode, reusing `orchestration-graph.tsx` in a static (non-live) rendering by passing the mode's `agents_involved` as `doneNodeIds`.

**Resume UI (`/runs`).** `web/src/app/(app)/runs/page.tsx` fetches `GET /api/runs/{id}/checkpoints` for every visible run up front (not lazily on row-expand — a lazy fetch means a "Needs approval" badge can never show until a row's already been opened once, defeating its purpose as something to scan the list for), and shows Approve/Reject buttons calling `POST /api/orchestration/{run_id}/resume` for any row with a pending `hitl_request`. Rows are always expandable now, not gated on `steps.length > 0` — workflow modes never populate `agent_execution_steps` (only "tool" mode's `log_execution_step()` calls do), so that gate used to hide the expand affordance for exactly the runs most likely to have a pending approval.

Both chat endpoints resolve an orchestration mode (request body `mode` -> `settings.ORCHESTRATION_MODE` -> `"tool"`) via `orchestrator.modes.get_mode()` and dispatch through it — `orchestrator/modes/` is what makes those modes reachable from a live request rather than tests-only. Five are registered: `tool` (default, LLM calls `call_specialist_agent`), `handoff` (`orchestrator/handoff.py`'s `HandoffBuilder` mesh), `workflow:pre-purchase` (`workflows/pre_purchase.py`'s concurrent fan-out/fan-in), `workflow:return-replace` (`workflows/return_replace.py`'s sequential graph with an in-workflow `ctx.request_info` HITL gate), and `group-chat` (`workflows/group_chat.py`'s round-table debate, two agent-backed panelists then a moderator). The two workflow modes and group-chat resolve a product_id/order_id out of the chat message themselves (a UUID literal if present, else a lookup — `search_products` / the user's most recent order) since neither underlying workflow ever took free text.

**Checkpoints + resume (Phase 1.5).** `PrePurchaseMode` and `ReturnReplaceMode` attach `shared.factory.get_checkpoint_storage()` to every workflow run, wrapped in `shared.checkpoint_storage.RecordingCheckpointStorage` so each save surfaces as its own `kind="checkpoint"` event (MAF's own event stream never mentions a save). `chat.py`'s `_link_run_artifacts()` correlates a run's `usage_logs` row to its checkpoints (`workflow_checkpoints.usage_log_id`) and, when `workflow:return-replace` pauses, writes a `hitl_requests` row carrying MAF's own resume token (`request_id`) and the paused checkpoint. `ReturnReplaceMode.resume()` — reached from `POST /api/orchestration/{run_id}/resume` — builds a *fresh* `Workflow` object (there's no live one to reuse; the one that paused lived in a prior request's process memory) and resumes purely from `checkpoint_id` + `responses={request_id: approved}`, verified directly to replay correctly through discount and finalize. Note: `_HitlGateExecutor.on_approval()` (`workflows/return_replace.py`, unchanged) rebuilds a minimal `WorkflowState` from the approval-request snapshot on resume — `return_id`/`replacement_products` from the original run don't survive; `resume()`'s response text is written to not depend on them.

`chat_stream()` branches on the resolved mode: `tool` keeps its original direct-agent SSE path (no mode streams token-level deltas the way `_run_agent_native_stream` does), while every other mode streams through `get_mode(...).run()` directly, translating each `OrchestrationEvent` into an SSE frame — `delta` becomes real display text (extracted via `orchestrator.events.delta_text`) when it's present, `node_enter`/`node_exit` becomes `event: node`, `handoff` becomes `event: handoff`, `tool_call` becomes `event: step`, `checkpoint`/`request_info`/`error` get their own named frames. Not every mode streams incremental text — `handoff` does (its "output" events carry `AgentResponseUpdate` content), but the three MAF-workflow modes mostly don't (their executors call `ctx.send_message()`, which produces no delta; the one `ctx.yield_output()` carries a raw state dataclass) — so `_run_mode_task()` falls back to pushing `run_completed`'s full text as a single chunk if nothing streamed incrementally, guaranteeing every mode a non-empty visible response. The web client (`web/src/lib/api.ts::chatStream`) routes any SSE event name outside `step`/`metadata`/`delta`/plain-text to an `onOrchestrationEvent` hook rather than rendering it as chat text — no UI consumes these frames yet (that's Phase 1.6), but the parser had to be fixed to not corrupt the chat bubble with raw JSON once a caller sets `mode` to anything other than `tool`.

### MAF-Native Execution in agent_host.py

`shared/agent_host.py` is a lightweight A2A-compatible FastAPI host. It does **not** implement a custom tool-calling loop — the legacy `_run_agent_with_tools()` / `_run_agent_with_tools_stream()` OpenAI chat-completions loop was removed once MAF-native execution was confirmed compatible with production Azure deployments (see the module docstring). Every request now goes through MAF's own `agent.run()` (blocking) / `agent.run(..., stream=True)` (SSE streaming); the `Agent` object owns its tools, system prompt, and context-provider chain, so `agent_host.py` just threads the A2A request into the right MAF call and (for streaming) forwards chunks over SSE.

### MAF Package Patch

`agents/python/patch_maf.py` — workaround for a packaging bug in `agent-framework-core==1.0.0`, whose `__init__.py` shipped empty with no public re-exports. Fixed upstream by 1.14.0 (the version this repo now pins), so `patch()` is already a no-op on a current install (it only writes when the file is empty). The Dockerfile still runs it defensively; it does nothing today.

### YAML Prompt Composition System

Prompts are NOT hardcoded strings. `shared/prompt_loader.py` loads from `agents/python/config/prompts/{agent_name}.yaml` and composes: base prompt + grounding-rules (shared) + role-specific instructions + schema context + tool examples.

Shared prompt fragments live in `agents/python/config/prompts/_shared/` (grounding-rules.yaml, schema-context.yaml, tool-examples.yaml).

Each agent's `create_*_agent()` factory calls `get_system_prompt(current_user_role.get())` (which wraps `load_prompt(agent_name, user_role)`) at agent-construction time, and agents are rebuilt on every request (see `orchestrator/routes/chat.py`) — so the composed prompt is genuinely role-aware per request (admin sees different instructions than customer). Earlier revisions built the prompt once at *import* time with a hardcoded default role, which silently defeated the role-specific YAML blocks; that bug is fixed.

### Auth & Identity Flow

- **External requests**: JWT Bearer token validated by `AgentAuthMiddleware` in `shared/auth.py`
- **Inter-agent requests**: `X-Agent-Secret` header (shared secret) + `X-User-Email` / `X-User-Role` headers
- **Identity propagation**: Auth middleware sets ContextVars (`current_user_email`, `current_user_role`, `current_session_id`) which tools read directly — no parameter passing through the call stack

### Conversation History Forwarding

The orchestrator no longer forwards a truncated copy of the conversation history on A2A calls (that "last 10 messages, 500 chars each" window was removed — see the comment in `orchestrator/agent.py::call_specialist_agent`). Instead only the session id travels, via the `x-session-id` header; each specialist rehydrates prior context itself by querying Postgres for the session's messages (`shared/agent_host.py::_rehydrate_history_from_session`) when it needs to handle a follow-up contextually.

Separately, the orchestrator's own read of *its* conversation's history (for `RunContext.history`, forwarded into every orchestration mode) goes through `shared/session.py::get_history_as_dicts` + `get_history_provider`, not a hand-rolled `SELECT`. Message *writes* stay as each route's own richer `INSERT` (carries `agent_name`/`agents_involved`/`metadata` a generic `HistoryProvider` write doesn't) — see `orchestrator/routes/chat.py`'s module docstring for why a `HistoryProvider` isn't attached as an automatic `context_providers=[...]` hook (verified it would double-write).

## Specialist Agent Pattern

Each specialist agent follows this structure:
```
agent.py    -> create_*_agent() returning Agent with tools list + context providers
tools.py    -> @tool functions for this agent's domain (DB access via get_pool())
prompts.py  -> loads SYSTEM_PROMPT from YAML via prompt_loader
main.py     -> create_agent_app() entry point with telemetry + DB pool init in lifespan
```

Tools use MAF's `@tool` decorator with `Annotated` type hints (not Pydantic input models). All tools are `async` and access the database directly via `get_pool()` — no context dict passing.

## Frontend Notes

- **Next.js 16.x** — this version has breaking changes from training data. Always read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing frontend code.
- App Router with `(app)/` group for authenticated layout (sidebar + navigation)
- Auth via `lib/auth-context.tsx` (React context, localStorage persistence, JWT tokens)
- API client singleton in `lib/api.ts` — all backend calls go through this
- Chat interface supports SSE streaming via `chatStream()`
- Rich message rendering: markdown + product cards + order cards in `components/chat/`

## LLM Provider Configuration

Controlled via `LLM_PROVIDER` environment variable. Both providers use the same `agent-framework` ChatClient interface.

```bash
# OpenAI (default for local dev)
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4.1

# Azure OpenAI
LLM_PROVIDER=azure
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=...
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4.1
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-12-01-preview
```

## Database

- Schema in `docker/postgres/init.sql` (34 tables)
- All queries use parameterized `$1, $2` syntax (asyncpg)
- All user-facing queries filter by `user_email` or `user_id`
- Embeddings stored as `vector(1536)` with ivfflat cosine index
- Seeder (`scripts/seed.py`) is deterministic (`random.seed(42)`) — reproducible demo data

## Coding Conventions

- MAF `@tool` decorator with `Annotated` type hints
- `async` everywhere — all tools, all DB queries, all HTTP calls
- `asyncpg` for PostgreSQL (connection pool via `get_pool()`, not ORM)
- `httpx` for async HTTP (never `requests`)
- Pydantic Settings for configuration (`shared/config.py`)
- ContextVars for request-scoped state (`shared/context.py`)
- Type hints on all functions
- f-strings for string formatting
- Guard clauses for early returns

## Do Not

- Create custom tool registries — use MAF's built-in `@tool`
- Write raw OpenAI function-calling loops — use the existing `agent_host.py` pattern
- Use `pip` or `poetry` — use `uv` for Python
- Use `npm` or `yarn` — use `pnpm` for Node
- Skip type hints on any function
- Use `requests` — use `httpx` for async HTTP
- Hardcode prompts in Python — use YAML config in `agents/python/config/prompts/`
- Pass user identity as function args — use ContextVars from `shared/context.py`
