# ECommerceAgents — .NET Backend

A complete, working .NET / C# implementation of the platform, built with Microsoft Agent
Framework alongside the Python backend at `../python/`. Development here is Python-first — see
[`../../docs/parity-matrix.md`](../../docs/parity-matrix.md) for exactly which concepts are at
full parity today versus still on the .NET backlog.

Both stacks share:
- Postgres schema at `../../docker/postgres/init.sql`
- Prompt YAML at `../python/config/prompts/`
- Seed data produced by `../../scripts/seed.py`
- Next.js frontend at `../../web/` (selects backend via `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_STACK=python|dotnet`)

## Projects

| Project | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `src/ECommerceAgents.Shared` | library | Config, auth, telemetry, context providers, prompt loader, DB pool |
| `src/ECommerceAgents.Orchestrator` | 8080 | ASP.NET Core minimal API; HandoffBuilder-based routing |
| `src/ECommerceAgents.ProductDiscovery` | 8081 | Product catalog agent |
| `src/ECommerceAgents.OrderManagement` | 8082 | Order lifecycle agent |
| `src/ECommerceAgents.PricingPromotions` | 8083 | Pricing + coupon agent |
| `src/ECommerceAgents.ReviewSentiment` | 8084 | Review summarization agent |
| `src/ECommerceAgents.InventoryFulfillment` | 8085 | Inventory + shipping agent |

Test projects mirror each under `tests/`.

## Build + test

```bash
cd agents/dotnet
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

## Run the full .NET stack

```bash
# From repo root — one-command helper (builds, seeds, and starts everything):
./scripts/dev.sh --dotnet      # PowerShell: ./scripts/dev.ps1 -Dotnet

# Or plain Docker Compose. Every app service (seeder, agents, MCP host,
# frontend) is gated behind a profile — only db/redis/aspire start
# unconditionally — so `up --build` with no --profile flags only brings up
# infrastructure. Include all four profiles to get the full app:
docker compose -f docker-compose.dotnet.yml \
  --profile seed --profile agents --profile mcp --profile frontend up --build
```

The Next.js frontend at `http://localhost:3000` will talk to the .NET orchestrator at `:8080` when `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_STACK=dotnet`.

## Central package management

All package versions live in `Directory.Packages.props` at this folder root. Individual `.csproj` files use `<PackageReference Include="..." />` without a `Version=` attribute.

## Status

The .NET backend is functionally complete for the core domain: all six specialist agents plus an
MCP server (`ECommerceAgents.Mcp`, real JSON-RPC over streamable HTTP via the official
`ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore` SDK) are implemented, along with a shared layer covering A2A
client/host, JWT auth middleware, tool audit logging, PII redaction, checkpoint storage
(in-memory, file, and Postgres backends), declarative workflow primitives, and config validation.

It is **not** at full parity with the Python backend — see
[`../../docs/parity-matrix.md`](../../docs/parity-matrix.md) for the honest, per-concept
breakdown. Agent middleware/context providers are now wired into every live agent, specialist
agents have a real `/message:stream` SSE endpoint (with live delta forwarding through the
orchestrator's own chat stream), the guardrail stack now includes inbound prompt-injection
detection, stored-content sanitization, and output moderation, every tool call is now
captured into a live agentic timeline (`/runs`, `event: step` SSE frames) across both the
orchestrator and specialist processes, both `PrePurchaseWorkflow` and `ReturnAndReplaceWorkflow`
(including its pause/resume HITL gate, on a real `RequestPort`) run on real MAF `WorkflowBuilder`
graphs, and human-in-the-loop tool approval is a real function-invocation pipeline stage rather
than a call-site wrapper each gated tool had to invoke itself. A shared tool library now lives in `Shared/Tools/`, so cross-cutting
tools are registered by whichever specialists need them rather than duplicated per agent.
Workflow pause and resume is durable: a run checkpoints through MAF's own store and is rebuilt
from that checkpoint on resume, so a pending approval survives an orchestrator restart. The
money paths — returns, refunds, approved actions and checkout — are idempotent.

The remaining gaps are handoff and group-chat modes, MCP client consumption, telemetry depth,
and the evals harness; all python-first. Magentic is in neither stack, so it is not a gap.
See [`docs/parity-matrix.md`](../../docs/parity-matrix.md) for the row-by-row breakdown.

Eight test projects mirror the source structure — one per agent plus Shared and MCP — with 515 test methods covering tools, middleware, guardrails, timeline capture, workflows, auth, streaming, and A2A protocol behavior (verified directly: `dotnet test ECommerceAgents.sln`). The same PostgreSQL schema and A2A wire format are used across both stacks; you can point the frontend at either backend by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_STACK=dotnet`.

Remaining work is tracked in the one consolidated plan, [`.claude/plans/remaining-work.md`](https://github.com/nitin27may/e-commerce-agents/blob/26f47c494dd6b371312593e82f066713f6f56e9c/.claude/plans/remaining-work.md).
