/// <summary>
/// Tool-level human-in-the-loop approval gate — .NET parity port of
/// Python's <c>HITLFunctionMiddleware</c> (<c>shared/hitl.py</c>), now a
/// real interception layer (issue #17, piece 2 of 3) rather than a
/// call-site wrapper each gated tool had to invoke itself
/// (<c>HitlApprovalMiddleware.GuardAsync</c>, removed by this change).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Wired into <see cref="Agents.SpecialistPipeline"/>'s function-invocation
/// seam, the same one <c>ToolAuditMiddleware</c> and <c>OutputSanitizer</c>
/// already use — the "generic pipeline stage can't express a per-tool
/// pendingResult shape" objection the old call-site design was built
/// around doesn't actually hold: Python's own middleware doesn't preserve
/// each gated tool's typed result shape for the pending case either — it
/// returns one generic <c>{status, message, request_id}</c> shape for all
/// five gated tools (<c>hitl.py</c> lines ~123-131). This mirrors that
/// exactly rather than trying to synthesize a typed <c>CancelOrderResult</c>
/// / <c>PlaceBackorderResult</c> / etc. generically from
/// <see cref="Microsoft.Extensions.AI.FunctionInvocationContext.Arguments"/>.
///
/// A gated tool method itself (<see cref="ECommerceAgents.OrderManagement.Tools.OrderTools.CancelOrder"/>,
/// <c>ModifyOrder</c>, <see cref="ECommerceAgents.InventoryFulfillment.Tools.InventoryTools.PlaceBackorder"/>)
/// is now only ever reached when this gate lets the call through — it no
/// longer knows or needs to know it's gated. Calling one of those methods
/// directly (as some tests still legitimately do, to exercise its own
/// business logic in isolation) bypasses this gate entirely, since gating
/// now lives at the agent's function-invocation pipeline layer, not inside
/// the method body — the same trade-off every other pipeline stage
/// (audit, sanitization, step recording) already has.
