/// This is the first entry in a shared .NET tool library (issue #18). It is
/// first because without it the specialists that take a <c>productId</c> are
/// unusable from a normal question: asked "what are customers saying about the
/// Dyson V15?", the model has no way to turn that name into an id, so it
/// invents one. Observed live against the real stack before this shipped —
/// review-sentiment called AnalyzeSentiment, GetSentimentTrend and
/// DetectFakeReviews in turn, each with the made-up id "dyson-v15-id", got
/// "Product not found" three times, and told the user the product doesn't
/// exist. It does exist; only the lookup was missing.
///
/// Attached to the same three specialists Python attaches it to
/// (pricing-promotions, review-sentiment, inventory-fulfillment) — the ones
/// whose tools are keyed by product id. product-discovery and order-management
/// don't need it: they already resolve products by name themselves.
