"""Issue #9 — a specialist must receive the conversation's prior turns.

The bug this file exists to prevent is subtle enough that every *other*
session-related test in this repo passed while production was broken:

    web/src/lib/api.ts never sends an ``x-session-id`` header
      -> orchestrator/routes/chat.py never sets ``current_session_id``
        -> build_a2a_headers() forwards ``x-session-id: ""``
          -> shared/agent_host.py::_rehydrate_history_from_session returns
             None at its ``if not session_id`` guard, before touching the DB
            -> the specialist answers every follow-up with no prior context

Nothing failed. The specialist just silently started from a blank slate, so
"which one has the longest battery life?" reached product-discovery as a bare
comparative with no antecedent. It looked like LLM nondeterminism because the
orchestrator *does* hold the history and its prompt asks it to inline context
into the specialist message — a non-deterministic instruction that sometimes
worked.

Every existing test that appears to cover this sets the ContextVar or the
header by hand (``test_orchestrator_intent.py::test_session_id_forwarded_in_headers``,
``test_service_token.py``, ``test_streaming_steps.py``), which is precisely
why they kept passing. These two drive a real HTTP request instead, and assert
the two halves of the chain that production actually runs.
