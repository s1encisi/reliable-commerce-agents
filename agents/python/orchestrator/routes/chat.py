"""Chat routes — ``/api/chat``, ``/api/chat/stream``.

Split out of the pre-Phase-1 monolithic ``routes.py`` (now ``.legacy``)
because chat is the one route every orchestration mode touches. ``chat()``
now dispatches through ``orchestrator.modes.get_mode()`` (mode precedence:
request body ``mode`` -> ``settings.ORCHESTRATION_MODE`` -> registry
default) instead of calling the tool-router agent directly.

``chat_stream()`` branches on the resolved mode: ``tool`` keeps its
original direct-agent streaming path unchanged (``ToolRouterMode.run()``
awaits the full response before yielding anything, so routing the
default mode through the registry would replace real incremental
streaming with a single end-of-run dump). Every other mode streams
through ``get_mode(...).run()`` directly. Some — ``handoff`` — carry real
incremental text (verified against a live run: the ``"output"`` event
type maps to ``kind="delta"`` via ``adapt_workflow_event``, and its data
is ``AgentResponseUpdate``-shaped, which ``events.delta_text()`` can
read). Others don't: the fan-out/fan-in and sequential MAF workflows
(``workflow:pre-purchase``, ``workflow:return-replace``, ``group-chat``)
mostly call ``ctx.send_message()`` between executors, which produces no
delta at all, and their one ``ctx.yield_output()`` carries the raw state
dataclass, not ``AgentResponseUpdate`` content — verified against a live
pre-purchase run. For those, ``_run_mode_task()`` falls back to pushing
``run_completed``'s full text as a single chunk if nothing streamed
incrementally, so every mode is guaranteed a non-empty visible response
either way.

History (Phase 1.5): both endpoints read conversation history via
``shared.session.get_history_as_dicts`` + ``get_history_provider`` instead
of a hand-rolled ``SELECT ... FROM messages``. The read now happens
*before* the current turn's user message is inserted — the old order
(insert, then select) meant the just-inserted row came back in
``history`` and got appended a second time by
``shared/agent_host.py::_history_as_maf_messages``, which always appends
the current message itself. Message *writes* are untouched: a generic
``HistoryProvider.save_messages()`` only persists role/content, not the
``agent_name``/``agents_involved``/``metadata`` this app's own insert
carries for the timeline UI — verified directly that attaching a
``HistoryProvider`` as an automatic ``context_providers=[...]`` hook
would auto-save on every turn and double up rows, so it's deliberately
not wired that way.

    only thing that tells a specialist which conversation to rehydrate from
    (``shared/agent_host.py::_rehydrate_history_from_session``).

    It is otherwise set in exactly four places, and every one of them reads an
    inbound ``x-session-id`` *header*. The browser never sends that header, so
    the value forwarded to specialists was always ``""`` — and rehydration
    short-circuits on empty before it touches the database, without logging.
    Specialists therefore answered every browser-originated follow-up from a
    blank slate.

    This belongs here rather than in ``optional_auth``/``require_auth``
    because this is the only layer that knows the conversation id: it arrives
    in the request *body*, and is often created a few lines above rather than
    supplied at all.

    Callers must pass ``None`` for anonymous requests. ``body.conversation_id``
    is client-supplied and is only ownership-checked on the authed path, so
    binding it for an anonymous caller would let anyone rehydrate any
