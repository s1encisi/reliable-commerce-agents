"""MAF Handoff workflow for the orchestrator → specialist mesh.

This is the ``handoff`` alternative to the ``tool``-mode
``call_specialist_agent`` tool router. ``orchestrator/modes/handoff_mode.py``
wraps :func:`build_orchestrator_handoff_workflow` and is what makes this
reachable from a live request — via ``mode="handoff"`` on ``/api/chat``, or
``ORCHESTRATION_MODE=handoff`` as the deployment-wide default. MAF routes
turns between the orchestrator and the specialists mechanically via the
Handoff orchestration.

Each specialist is a :class:`~shared.remote_agent.RemoteSpecialistChatClient`
wrapped in an ``Agent``, so handoffs still traverse A2A HTTP on the wire
— the mechanism is Handoff, the transport is A2A.

Default stays tool-based (``ORCHESTRATION_MODE=tool``), so this module is
additive; nothing in the existing runtime changes unless a request or the
deployment config selects ``handoff``.

    This is NOT ``create_orchestrator_agent()``, and that distinction is the

    ``tool`` calls ``call_specialist_agent`` and keeps ownership of the turn;
    ``handoff`` calls a MAF-synthesised handoff tool and *transfers* ownership.

    Handing the tool-router orchestrator to ``HandoffBuilder`` gives it two
    competing routing mechanisms, and it uses the one its system prompt names —
    so it never calls a handoff tool. Microsoft's guidance is explicit that this
    is fatal here: an agent that responds instead of handing off leaves the
    workflow with nowhere to go but back to the user. With autonomous mode on,
    that becomes an unbounded self-continuation loop.
