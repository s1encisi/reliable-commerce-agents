"""``workflow:pre-purchase`` and ``workflow:return-replace`` modes.

Wraps the already-built, already-tested MAF ``WorkflowBuilder`` graphs in
``workflows/pre_purchase.py`` (concurrent fan-out/fan-in) and
``workflows/return_replace.py`` (sequential with an in-workflow HITL
gate) — per the audit, previously reachable only from their own test
suites, never from a live request.

ID resolution: neither workflow's ``execute(state)`` accepts free text —
both were only ever driven by a hand-built dataclass in tests. Each mode
here resolves a product_id / order_id out of the chat message before
building that initial state: a UUID literal in the message if present,
else a lightweight lookup (``search_products`` for pre-purchase, the
current user's most recent order for return-replace).

HITL + checkpoints (Phase 1.5): every ``.run()`` call on the built MAF
workflow attaches a checkpoint storage backend (``shared.factory.get_checkpoint_storage``,
``None`` if no pool is configured — checkpointing degrades to a no-op
rather than failing), wrapped in ``RecordingCheckpointStorage`` so each
save can be surfaced as its own ``kind="checkpoint"`` event — MAF's own
event stream never mentions a save, verified directly. Every
``run_completed`` payload carries ``latest_checkpoint_id``. For
return-replace specifically, a pause also carries ``request_id`` (MAF's
own resume token, read off the adapted ``request_info`` event) — together
these are exactly what a *separate* request needs to resume a *different*
``Workflow`` object from the paused one: verified directly that
``workflow.run(responses={request_id: ...}, checkpoint_id=..., checkpoint_storage=...)``
on a freshly-built workflow (not the one that paused) replays correctly
through to ``finalize``. ``ReturnReplaceMode.resume()`` is that second
call; ``orchestrator/routes/orchestration.py``'s resume endpoint is what
reaches it from a live request — the first caller for both.
