"""``handoff`` mode: MAF ``HandoffBuilder`` mesh over the same specialists.

Wraps ``orchestrator/handoff.py::build_orchestrator_handoff_workflow`` —
already built, already tested (``tests/test_handoff_orchestration.py``),
never previously reachable from a live request. This is the first thing
that reaches it: ``ORCHESTRATION_MODE=handoff`` or a per-request
``mode="handoff"`` now actually runs the mesh instead of the tool router.

Final-answer and participant-order extraction mirrors
``tutorials/14-handoff-orchestration/python/main.py::ask()`` — that
tutorial is the verified reference for how to read a handoff workflow's
event stream (confirmed against real Azure calls in Phase 0): "output"
events carry incremental ``AgentResponseUpdate`` text per executor id, and
the final answer is the last participant's fully-assembled turn.
