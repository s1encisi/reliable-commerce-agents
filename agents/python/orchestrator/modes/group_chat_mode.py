"""``group-chat`` mode: sequential round-table debate over a shared transcript.

Wraps ``workflows/group_chat.py``'s ``GroupChatWorkflow`` — per the audit,
exercised only with synthetic sync responders in its own tests. This is
the first production caller: two agent-backed panelists (a value/pricing
perspective and a quality/reviews perspective), each seeing what the
previous ones said, followed by a moderator that synthesizes a verdict.
Per that module's own docstring, this is a *distinct* MAF pattern from
the others already wired — not a fan-out (``workflow:pre-purchase``) and
not an LLM tool router (``tool``) or mesh (``handoff``) — useful when a
decision benefits from multiple named perspectives rather than one
specialist's answer.

Required a small change to ``workflows/group_chat.py``: ``Responder`` was
strictly synchronous (every existing test only ever passed a plain
function). A real panelist needs an LLM call, which is async —
``_PanelistExecutor.run()`` now awaits the responder's result when it's
awaitable, so this mode can pass a coroutine-returning closure without
``workflows/group_chat.py`` needing to know anything about MAF ``Agent``.
