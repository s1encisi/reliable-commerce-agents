"""Grounding ledger — typed facts recorded from this turn's tool results.

Mirrors the ``current_steps`` / ``StepRecorderMiddleware`` pattern in
``shared/agent_observability.py``: a ``FunctionMiddleware`` appends to a
ContextVar-backed object after every tool call, and is a no-op when the
ContextVar is unset (outside a request that opted into grounding capture).

Tool results are not uniformly shaped — product tools key their id as ``id``,
``get_order_details`` keys it as ``order_id`` (see ``order_management/tools.py``),
and neither ``products`` nor any tool result carries a ``stock`` column (stock
lives in ``warehouse_inventory``, surfaced only by ``check_stock`` under
``product_id``/``in_stock``/``total_quantity`` — a different shape again). So
facts are recognized by duck-typing on the combination of keys a given tool
shape actually returns, not by a single hardcoded id key.
