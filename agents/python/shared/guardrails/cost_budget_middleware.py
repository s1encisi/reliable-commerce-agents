"""Per-run cost budget ceiling — the runtime consumer of ``shared/cost.py``.

Before this, ``estimate_cost()`` (``shared/cost.py``) had exactly one caller:
``evals/evaluator.py``, which prices a *completed* eval run for reporting.
Nothing read it at runtime, so an agentic loop that keeps calling tools and
re-prompting the model had no ceiling on what a single run could spend —
only a post-hoc number you'd see after the money was already spent.
``CostBudgetMiddleware`` closes that gap: it estimates the cost of every LLM
turn as the run happens and, in ``enforce`` mode, refuses to start another
turn once the running total crosses ``COST_BUDGET_USD_PER_RUN``.

Two-tier posture, mirroring ``GROUNDING_MODE`` (``shared/config.py``):

- ``off``     — the middleware isn't attached at all (see
  ``shared/middleware.py::build_specialist_middleware``).
- ``observe`` — accumulates and logs the running cost; never blocks, even
  past the configured ceiling. Safe default: turning this on can't change
  a run's outcome, only its logs.
- ``enforce`` — same accumulation, plus a hard stop: once the running total
  exceeds ``COST_BUDGET_USD_PER_RUN``, the *next* LLM turn is refused before
  it's made. Mirrors ``InjectionDetectionChatMiddleware``'s blocking
  mechanism (``shared/guardrails/injection_middleware.py``): the middleware
  sets ``context.result`` to a refusal and returns without calling
  ``call_next()``, so the flagged turn never reaches the chat client. A
  turn already "in flight" when the ceiling is crossed is never aborted
  mid-call — cost is only knowable *after* a turn completes (from its
  ``usage_details``), so enforcement is necessarily one turn behind the
  actual overage. This is the same trade-off ``GroundingVerificationMiddleware``
  makes for streamed content: correct the next decision point, not the one
  already in flight.

``current_run_cost_usd`` is the readable, accumulating side effect other code
can inspect mid-run (e.g. a future budget dashboard), following the same
ContextVar shape as ``shared.guardrails.flags.current_guardrail_flags`` and
``shared.grounding.ledger.current_grounding_ledger``: ``None`` by default,
set to a fresh baseline at the start of a request/run. Unlike those two
siblings, this middleware does not require an external ``reset_*()`` call to
become active — the first turn of any run lazily treats an unset ContextVar
as a ``0.0`` baseline and starts accumulating immediately. That's a deliberate
difference: this repo's ContextVars for user identity
(``shared/context.py::current_user_email`` et al.) already rely on the same
property this exploits — each concurrent request runs in its own asyncio
Task, and a Task's context is a snapshot taken at creation time, so mutations
in one request's task are invisible to another's without any explicit reset.
``reset_run_cost()`` is still exported for callers that want an explicit,
guaranteed-clean boundary (mirroring ``reset_guardrail_flags()``'s call site
in ``evals/harness.py``) — e.g. a future eval harness integration — but the
middleware itself does not depend on it being called.
