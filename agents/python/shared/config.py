"""Pydantic Settings for E-Commerce Agents.

Every env var used anywhere in the codebase is declared here. Downstream
modules never call `os.environ` directly — they import `settings` or one
of the factories in `shared.factory`.

Env-var aliases:
- `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` (current) and `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` (MAF convention)
  both bind to the same field.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` (current) and `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`
  (MAF convention) both bind to the same field.
Existing names take precedence; the aliases exist so MAF docs read naturally
without breaking our current `.env` files.
