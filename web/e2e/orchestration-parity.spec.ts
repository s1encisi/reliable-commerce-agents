 * The parity gate: the orchestration-showcase surfaces, asserted the same way
 * against both backends.
 *
 * These are deliberately the features the rest of `web/e2e/` never touches.
 * That suite is 109 tests across 9 specs and references the backend-sensitive
 * surfaces exactly once in total, so it passes green against a .NET backend
 * with four features missing. Everything here checks for *presence* — the
 * failures being guarded against are silent ones:
 *
 *   - the mode switcher returns `null` when `GET /modes` 404s, so it vanishes
 *     rather than erroring
 *   - `/runs` swallows a 404 in `.catch(() => {})`, so the page looks healthy
 *     with permanently empty panels
 *   - the profile's "AI Memory" card says "chat with the product or review
 *     agents to build your profile", which on .NET can never work
 *   - `mode` is dropped by a backend whose request record has no such field,
 *     so a user picks a workflow and silently gets tool mode
 *
 * A test asserting "no error appeared" would pass against every one of those.

 * used to be `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, inlined into the bundle at build time, so
 * a second dev server booting off a warm build directory silently served the
 * first one's backend. Since the frontend proxies `/api/*` server-side, the
 * address is `ORCHESTRATOR_URL`, read at runtime, and no build can encode the
 * wrong backend.
 *
 * The guard stays because the failure did not go away, it moved: a frontend
 * started with the wrong `ORCHESTRATOR_URL` fails in exactly the same shape —
 * login against backend A, every API-level assertion here against backend B,
 * and a green run that never touched the backend it claims. The token is still
 * the cheapest discriminator: it is signed by whichever backend served the
 * login, so a 401 from `ORCH_URL` means the two are not the same process.
