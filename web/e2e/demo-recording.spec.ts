/**
 * demo-recording.spec.ts
 *
 * Records the 60-90 second silent clip that sits at the top of the README and
 * the docs site home. Not a test — it asserts almost nothing. It drives the app
 * through the six things that make this repo different, in one continuous take:
 *
 *   1. Streaming chat with generative UI (product cards, not raw JSON)
 *   2. Switching orchestration mode from the composer
 *   3. The orchestration graph animating node-by-node from live SSE events
 *   4. A workflow pausing on its human-in-the-loop gate
 *   5. The pending approval on /runs
 *   6. Approve, and the run resuming from a real Postgres checkpoint
 *
 * Requires the full stack running with a live LLM key:
 *   ./scripts/dev.sh --demo
 *
 * Run:
 *   cd web && pnpm exec playwright test e2e/demo-recording.spec.ts
 *
 * Output: test-results/<...>/video.webm. Convert for embedding with
 *   ffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -crf 24 -pix_fmt yuv420p demo.mp4
 *
 * Being a committed script rather than a manual screen capture means it can be
 * re-recorded after any UI change instead of decaying into a stale clip.
 *
 * ── Two things that will ruin the take, both learned the hard way ────────────
 *
 * Prompts must be ones the catalogue can actually answer. `search_products`
 * does ILIKE '%<whole phrase>%', so "running shoes" matches nothing while
 * "Allbirds" matches — the seeded catalogue has no product whose text contains
 * the word "shoes". A natural-sounding prompt that returns "I couldn't find
 * any" is the worst possible first impression, so every prompt below is
 * verified against the seed data.
 *
 * Never wait on text like "Routing to specialists...". The composer's submit
 * button swaps to a stop icon while a turn is in flight and swaps back when it
 * completes; that is the only reliable signal. Waiting on text races the
 * stream, and a click landing mid-stream silently no-ops.
